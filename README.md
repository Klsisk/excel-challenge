# Excel : Kickstart My Chart

## Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

### Objective
Using Excel, odify and analyze the data of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some market trends.

### Conclusions
Given the provided data, three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns are:

1. The first conclusion we can draw is that theater campaigns had the most successful campaigns of any categories, with plays having the most successful campaigns of the sub-categories amongst all the countries.
2. The second conclusion we can draw is that theater campaigns had the most failed campaigns of the categories, with plays also having the most failed campaigns of the sub-categories amongst all the countries.  So while these campaigns could do well, they could also be quite risky as they had a fair amount of failure too.
3. The third conclusion that was especially noticeable from the third pivot chart was that the number of successful campaigns really started to decline towards the end of the year, specifically in the months of November and December.

### Limitations
Some limitations of this dataset are as follows:
One limitation is that we know very little about the creators of each of the campaigns.  If we knew more about their experience (how many campaigns they have done in the past), we could look at how that compared with the rate of successful vs failed campaigns.  We also don’t have much detailed information on location past which country it comes from.  For example, many projects come out of the US.  It would be great to know more information on which states they come from so that you can delve into possibly what parts of the US have the most successful campaigns and which do not.

### Other Possible Graphs
Some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could chart to see where most of the projects are coming from as far as countries.  We could then look into it even more to see how many successful, live, canceled, or failed campaigns there were in various countries. Another possible table could be to look at how long each of the campaigns last.  From looking at the date when many were launched to when they ended, many don’t look they last more than a month.  Could longer projects or shorter projects be more successful?  It would be interesting to look at.

### Bonus Statistical Analysis
1.	Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.

I think the median summarizes the data more meaningfully in successful or failed campaigns.  The reason I think this is because when you see the data in a chart (see attached sheets in Excel), you can visually see that the data is skewed because the mean is inflated by the outliers.

2.	Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?  

Successful campaigns have more variability. This makes more sense to me as a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a large range of values.  The unsuccessful campaigns are showing less variability.  The lower standard deviation shows that the data is more clustered around the mean. This makes sense because the criteria for a failed campaign is having fewer backers, which means the standard deviation is low while a successful campaign has more backers, giving it a higher standard deviation.
